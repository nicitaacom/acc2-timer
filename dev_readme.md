This project was created to show my skills of how can I create timer using Next.js and TypeScript

```
Technical task: Implementation of a countdown timer in React / Next.js
Description:
It is necessary to develop an application with a countdown timer in React (or Next.js, if preferred). The timer should be able to:
1 Show the remaining time in MM:SS format (minutes:seconds).
2 Update every second.
3 Stop the countdown when the time is up and display the message "Time is up".
4 A "Start/Pause" button that allows you to start or pause the timer at any time.
5 Provide a way to restart the timer with a "Reset" button.
6 The timer should be limited in operation, with a duration of 3 minutes
Implementation requirements:
1 Component structure:
◦ The application should be divided into components (for example: Timer, Controls, Input).
◦ Implement timer state management with minimal rerenders.
2 Working with state and re-renders:
◦ Optimize component rendering so that there are no extra renders every second.
3 Interface:
◦ Control buttons: "Start/Pause" and "Reset".
◦ Display a countdown on the screen.
◦ After the countdown is complete, display the message "Time is up".
4 Additional:
◦ Use of TypeScript is encouraged.
◦ The application should work correctly on both desktop and mobile devices. (Mozila, chrome, safary)
